I'm trying to build a predictive model that uses engine size to accurately predict CO2 emissions, with the goal of identifying potential reductions in emissions by optimizing engine size.

I'd love feedback on:
- The effectiveness of my model in predicting CO2 emissions
- Suggestions for improving the model's performance
- Ideas for additional features or modifications to enhance the model's accuracy
- Any errors or areas for improvement in my code or methodology.
